#
# This sample inventory file defines a node that provides a Broker component
# which is running in the local machine (ansible_connection: docker).
#
# The following node variables are mandatory:
# - component (determines a component that can be parsed by iqa [router, broker, client])
# - implementation (for broker, we currently just have: artemis)
#
# Broker component required variables:
# - broker_name
# - broker_web_port
# - broker_path
# - service (not needed when running as a container)
# - executor (defines the executor instance to be used for communicating with the node)
#
